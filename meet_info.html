  <h1> Meet Information</h1>

USA Track & Field (USATF) is the national governing body of track and field in America. Many world and national class athletes have cultivated their skills on the Junior Olympic circuit prior to entering college or professional ranks. All athletes must first register to become a member of USATF before competing in any USATF sanctioned meets. The USATF membership card is the official form athletes are required to have if they plan to compete on the Junior Olympic circuit. Parents and coaches may also purchase a membership card. These cards will serve as the athletes, coaches and parents pass for getting in all USATF youth sanctioned meets. It is a one time per year $20 fee for athletes and $30 for adults (2018). See the Coaching staff for registration forms. <br>
<h2>WHAT IS AGE GROUP TRACK?</h2>

Age group track and field competition is based on the athlete's age in the current calendar year. The following are the age group divisions for 2018 eligibility: 8 and Under (born in 2006 or after)

<h3>WHEN ARE THE MEETS AND HOW DO I ENTER THEM?</h3>

Meets usually occur weekly on Saturday or Sunday. Information will be given on Tuesdays concerning the meets during the season. PPTC coaching staff will determine what events your athlete will compete in and the administration team will enter them.

<h4>WILL PPTC HELP ME GET TO THESE MEETS?</h4>
<p>
For the most part, parents must secure transportation to the meets. However, if an athlete needs transportation, please contact a member of the coaching staff or administration team, WELL IN ADVANCE, to make arrangements.</p>
