<li>Uniform Fees will be paid directly to Amazink.  No payment arrangements can be made.  Money due at the time of order. </li>
<li>Meet Fees can be paid in installments.  Please speak with Coach Joyce about setting up payment arrangements. </li>
<li>Meet Fees can be paid weekly during the track season however payments must be made by Tuesday in order for your child's entry to be put into the system for the Saturday meet.  Please understand if you do not pay fees by Tuesday your child will not be entered in the meet for that week and will not compete. Plan for $5 per event and most athletes compete in 3 events so it is $15 per week.  Certain meets like State the fee is $6 per event so it would be $18 for that week. </li>
<li>If you need financial assistance with Track Fees please speak with Coach Joyce so arrangements can be made. </li>
