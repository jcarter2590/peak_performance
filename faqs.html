<h2>PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE</h2>
<p>Practices are held Monday - Thursday from 6:30PM- 7:30 PM. PPTC Coaching staff may call for an additional practices at times, but advance notice will be given. Parents and guardians are responsible for the athletes' transportation to and from practices. Please be on time.</p>
<h3>WHAT ARE THE PARENTS' ROLE IN THE CLUB? </h3><p>The parents are the main support to the Coaching staff. They give the Coaching staff valuable insight on the physical, emotional, and social aspect of their child. Most importantly, we expect the parents to be parents and provide the necessary support, encouragement and nurturing to their child. This way the coaches can provide the technical direction the athlete needs on the track and the parents can remain parents and we can all be one happy family(most of the time)!!!</p>
<h4>Is PPTC MORE THAN JUST PRACTICES AND MEETS? </h4><p>Yes! We are about educating the children about life as well as improving the athletes skill level in track and field. Most importantly, we are about keeping it FUN for the athletes while they improve, we do understand this is the summer. Please understand that we have athletes that are just learning and athletes that compete on a very high level. We appreciate the time and dedication of all the parents and athletes.</p>
